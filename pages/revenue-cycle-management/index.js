            <p>
              Each year, healthcare providers perform approximately 50 million
              procedures on patients. To collect revenue for these services,
              health systems must work closely with patients, doctors, and
              insurance companies. Healthcare organizations collect revenue
              through Revenue Cycle Management Company. Revenue cycle management
              services is key to a healthcare provider's long-term success. As a
              result, they will be able to provide patient care more effectively
              and more economically. In health care facilities, revenue cycle
              management software tracks patient care episodes from registration
              to payment. Combined administrative and clinical data includes
              names, insurance companies, and other personal information of
              patients. An imperative part of RCM is communicating with
              insurance companies. In most cases, physicians' offices and
              hospitals check the patient's insurance coverage when scheduling
              an appointment. ICD-10 codes are used when a healthcare provider
              categorizes a patient's treatment for a given condition after the
              patient pays any applicable copayment. After sending the care
              summary to insurance companies, hospitals and facilities decide
              how much will be covered by insurance and how much will be billed
              to patients.

                <h2>Factors That Can Affect RCM</h2>
                <span>
                  <p>
                    The provider has little control over the payment when a
                    claim has been denied or reviewed. There may be long delays
                    in the processing of billing and claims for provider
                    payments due to the increased efforts to combat healthcare
                    fraud and abuse. The provider may, however, be able to
                    control some internal factors. In order to improve their
                    RCM, providers should focus on improving productivity,
                    patient volume, and collecting fees. There are several
                    factors that can disrupt the RCM process, including:

                  Collecting Patient Payments
                </h3>

                <p>
                  It is becoming increasingly apparent that patients are
                  responsible for paying for their healthcare costs. Payments
                  collected during or before a patient's service eliminate the
                  risk of non-payments completely. Patients often have
                  difficulty affording high deductibles and are unaware of their
                  financial responsibilities, making this difficult. In order to
                  prevent the denial of a claim, patients should pre-register to
                  receive information about their medical history and insurance
                  information.

                  Fragmented Administrative Process
                </h3>

                <p>
                  There are often differences in priorities between the front
                  and back offices. It is possible that the denial of a claim
                  could result from the failure to share information.A better
                  communication process during the time of patient intake
                  regarding coverage eligibility may assist with payer
                  coordination, and claims reimbursement, as well as improve the
                  collection of payment.

                <p>
                  In order to achieve a successful outcome, it is crucial to
                  communicate with health insurance companies.Unless claims are
                  managed, they may remain pending, be rejected, or be denied.
                  Tracking claims can be useful in determining whether specific
                  procedures or codes are causing recurrences.

                  Lack Of Digital Workflow
                </h3>
                <p>
                  A lack of streamlined workflow may result in poor quality data
                  and problems with the revenue cycle in the future. It is
                  possible to simplify RCM and streamline report processing
                  through the implementation of a strong healthcare IT
                  infrastructure.In addition to seamless communication, an
                  electronic workflow eliminates lost paper documents.
