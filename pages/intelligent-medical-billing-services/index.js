              IMS is a health information management system consisting of
              Electronic Health Records (EHRs), Practice Management, Office
              Management, and Medical Billing.Software that adapts to practices
              of all sizes and types offers electronic prescribing, practice
              reporting, a patient portal, and communication tools. A
              cloud-based or on-premises platform is available with modules for
              more than 40 specialties. A single, comprehensive software
              package, IMS provides practice management, billing, and office

              multiple programs, as other systems require them to have multiple
              programs as well.

                      : Regulations must be followed by practices in order to
                      ensure that claims are honored. Rather than managing this
                      on your own, outsource billing to Advance Healthcare and

                      regulations.

                      : As a result of the pandemic, virtual patient
                      consultations gained popularity and are now an integral

                      that patient records will not be mixed up. We prevent
                      errors by using e-prescriptions, for example, delivering
                      medication to the wrong patient when using
                      e-prescriptions. The use of intelligent software is
                      designed to ensure that patient records are not lost or
                      misplaced.

                      changes in the prescribed billing template during the
                      billing process. When you encounter this conflict in
