              Under the referral management program, the patient's current
              physician or family physician refers them to another specialist or
              consultant. It occurs when a change in diagnosis occurs, or when a
              particular issue arises that requires the attention of a
              specialist rather than a physician. It is a platform that
              facilitates the exchange of patient data among physicians and
              between physicians and patients. A referral management system aims
              to facilitate communication between consultants, specialists,
              healthcare providers, and patients. Coordination of care and
              operational arrangements become more efficient, and treatment and
              diagnosis become more reliable.

                      When a patient is experiencing the most uncertain time in
                      his or her life, it is essential to treat them as
                      individuals with individual needs and concerns
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Assure professional autonomy and responsibility for
                      patients and their referrals
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Identify referral management as an important clinical
                      skill
                    </li>
