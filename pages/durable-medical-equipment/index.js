              As a result of the ever-changing regulatory compliance landscape,
              the durable medical equipment billing industry is undergoing
              constant revisions. For DME companies, outsourcing durable medical
              equipment billing services is the only way to stay current with
              the ever-changing DME billing landscape. Medical equipment
              providers face many challenges, including declining collections,
              billing errors, training new employees to perform billing
              functions, and suspended operations during periods of staff
              shortages.

            <p>
              A failure to address all existing problems can result in slow
              productivity and revenue growth. Keeping your focus on your core
              competencies is the most effective way to address these challenges
              by outsourcing DME billing services to us. To ensure that your
              reimbursements are higher and your cash flow is improved, we are
              available round the clock.

                  The medical policies of DME payors often differ between

                  up with all Medicare and Medicaid DME guidelines by regularly
                  checking the CMS's website.
