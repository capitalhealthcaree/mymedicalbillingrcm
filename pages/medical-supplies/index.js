              Depending on the supply item, Medicare will consider some supplies
              routine and not separately billable; while others are covered,
              billable, but packaged and not separately billed. HCPCS codes
              describe medical equipment and supplies, so insurers know what to
              expect. Your insurer receives claims with these codes. Afterwards,
              your insurer calculates your payments based on the code. Codes for
              HCPCS can show:

              <li>Wearing braces, wheelchairs, or other medical gear</li>

                    To provide you with additional information, the insurer may
                    add a two-digit modifier to the code. A physician, a durable
                    medical equipment manufacturer, or another provider may bill
                    HCPCS codes. Hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers offer
                    direct billing services.

                      Have you been unable to obtain care through your insurance
                      network, or are you seeking care outside of it? If you are
                      experiencing these problems, you might want to consider
                      renting instead of purchasing equipment.

                      After your procedure, you should review your bills and

                      the provider.
